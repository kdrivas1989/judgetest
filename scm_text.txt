1.7.  Elimination of a Discipline
1.7.1	
Disciplines shall be assessed periodically to determine if the expectation of future participation justifies their continued existence 
with respect to competitiveness, international representation, and costs to the Hosts and competitors.    When participation in 
a discipline drops below the thresholds described below, the discipline’s status must be added to the Competition Committee 
agenda at the next USPA Board Meeting.
1.7.2	
The threshold will be met for a discipline when the average ratio of registered competitors (including test events) to required 
judges drops below 4.   The average will be taken over 2 consecutive years.
1.7.2.1	
Events excluded from 1.7.2 include AL Team Accuracy & SP Mixed Teams.
1.7.2.2	
Due to its unique equipment costs, the threshold for the Accuracy discipline will be when the average number of registered 
competitors over 3 National Championships drops below 18.  Participation beginning in 2023 will be used when applying this rule.
1.7.3	
If a discipline is eliminated, then SCM Ch 4, 3.1.3 may be applied, but without the possibility of TTF funding. 
1.7.4	
New disciplines shall be exempt from these guidelines for their first 3 years.   Test events/classes/disciplines must be promoted 
to official status or be dropped after no more than 2 years.
1.7.5	
Hosts awarded a competition while certain disciplines were active may include those disciplines. Any removal of a discipline from 
a scheduled National Championship must be announced at least six months before its first event.

7.2.  Wind Tunnels, Training and Fun Jumps
7.2.1	
For all FS/VFS events, CF events except Rotations, and the WS Acrobatic event, once such an event’s draw has been made public 
and until the event has completed, no competitor or team registered in the event will be permitted to make non-competition 
skydives.   FS/VFS & Wingsuit Acrobatic competitors affected by this rule are also prohibited from using a wind tunnel.   Excep­
tions to this rule may be made at the discretion of the Meet Director with concurrence of the Chief Judge.

7.2.3	
Freefall videographer’s jumps during the championships are not considered training or fun jumps.
7.3.  Videographers
7.3.1	
Each team in the AE, CF, FS, VFS, MFS and WS Acrobatic events will include a videographer who will provide the evidence required 
to judge each round. The videographer need not be the same team member for every round.
•	
For the purpose of these rules, air-to-air video equipment shall consist of the complete video system(s) used to record the video 
evidence of the team’s freefall performance, including camera(s), recording media, cables, and battery(ies), and excluding any 
post-recording editor or graphics processing equipment.
•	
All video equipment must provide a high-definition digital-video file in a compatible file format approved by the Video Controller 
containing a 1080-type digital signal with a minimum frame rate of 50 frames per second.
•	
Each videographer must use the video transmission system provided by the organizer. The videographer is responsible for ensuring 
the compatibility of the video equipment with the scoring system.
•	
The camera must be fixed static to the helmet.
•	
No roll, pitch, or yaw movements of the camera, mechanical, or digital zoom adjustment, or any digital effects (excluding “steady 
shot” or other image stabilization feature) may be used during competition jumps.
•	
As soon as possible after each jump is completed, the videographer must deliver the air-to-air video equipment (including the 
media used to record that jump) for copying at the designated video station.
•	
No post-processing, editing, or additional re-rendering of the video evidence is permitted.
•	
The media evidence must remain available for viewing or download until all scores are posted as final.
•	
Failure to meet any of these requirements will lead to a 20% score penalty (rounded down to the next whole number) for that round.
7.3.2	
Only one team videographer may jump on each jump.
7.3.3	
Additional videographers
•	
Non-team videographers (“outside videographers”) may accompany competitors/teams with prior permission of the team and 
Meet Director.
•	
In competition, an outside videographer may not engage in aerial contact with any team. 
•	
If in the opinion of the CJ, the EJs and the Video Review Panel, a videographer or cameraflyer (other than the team’s videographer) 
interferes with the judgeability of a team’s performance or through direct body contact adversely affects a team’s performance, a 
re-jump may be awarded. In this case the videographer or camera flyer responsible will not be permitted to participate in further 
video or camera jumps during the competition.
7.4.  Jump Order
Except where specified in the discipline-specific competition rules, the following procedure will be applied:
7.4.1	
Before starting the first round of each event, jump order numbers for each team or individual competitor will be determined by the 
Meet Director or their designee except when the discipline-specific section of the SCM for the event provides a different method.
7.4.2	
Teams or individuals will compete in this order, unless otherwise determined by the Meet Director.
7.5.  Jump Notification
7.5.1	
Teams or individuals will be given a call at least 15 minutes and five minutes before boarding the aircraft. Such calls may be im­
plemented by non-audible means if approved by the USPA Controller.
7.5.2	
If a team or individual does not arrive in time for boarding, they will be scored as having made the jump and assessed the max­
imum penalty. 
7.5.3	
Except for rejumps and the first jump of the day, each competitor is allowed a minimum time of 45 minutes from arriving at the 
competition site to the first call for the next competition jump. 
7.5.4	
For competitors who have entered in two events that are run concurrently, the minimum allowed time from arriving at the com­
petition site to the first call for the next jump, except for rejumps and the first jump of the day, is 30 minutes.
7.6.  Change or Interruption of Events
7.6.1	
If a round in an event is interrupted for any reason, the round will be completed at the earliest opportunity.
7.6.2	
In order to ensure completion or if the weather requires it, the Meet Director may run multiple events simultaneously.
7.7.  Competitor Refusal to Jump
7.7.1	
Competitors may refuse, at their own expense, to jump for reasons that violate good safety practices (e.g., clouds, aircraft, lack 
of oxygen, excessive cold, jump run inequality, video failure, high winds, premature pack opening, high-G jump runs).

They must ride the aircraft down unless ordered by the pilot to exit in emergencies. 
7.7.3	
If a competitor exits the aircraft (except in an emergency), the jump becomes official and will be scored. 
7.7.3.1	
In Formation Skydiving, this rule does not apply if the only competitor to exit the aircraft is the team’s videographer.
7.7.4	
If the Meet Director determines that the reasons for refusal are not considered pertinent, the team or individual will be scored 
as having made the jump and assessed the maximum penalty.
7.8.  Host and Meet Management Responsibilities
7.8.1	
The Host is responsible for providing a wind speed-measuring device capable of displaying wind velocity in meters per second.
7.8.2	
The Host is to provide sufficient staff (normally one or two persons) to make up the scoring and recording section of the judging 
staff.
7.8.3	
The Host must provide a video slate (or other suitable method) for AE, CF Rotations and WS events so that videographers can 
video their team number and round just before exit.
7.8.3.1	
The Host must provide the teams with a way of identification of the team showing the team number/round to be recorded 
by the Videographer just before exit. The recording of this or other clear identification of the team number and round should 
continue into with the jump without any stop in recording. Failure to meet this requirement will result in a score of zero (0) 
points for the relevant round.
7.8.4	
A meet announcement board, where official announcements including event holds, releases, scores, and protest results are 
posted, must be present. 
7.8.5	
Such announcements, and especially scores, become officially posted when placed on such an announcement board for perma­
nent, continuous public display.
8.  Policies And Procedures

or Meet Director to assure equal conditions for all teams and individuals on exit from all aircraft.
8.2.2.2	 It is the responsibility of the individual competitor or team captain to confirm airspeed and altitude except where the rules 
specific to the event indicate otherwise. 
8.2.2.3	 An individual competitor or team captain may request a second pass if aircraft speed or altitude is suspect (not within spec­
ified limits at time of intended exit).
8.2.3	 Aircraft pass limits
8.2.3.1	 No more than two aircraft passes over the target per competitor or team will be permitted for any jump. 
8.2.3.2	 A team or competitor that does not exit the aircraft on the second pass will be considered to have made the jump and scored

5.1.1	
Regional Judges
5.1.1.1	
A Regional Judge’s rating is permanent, concurrent with USPA membership.
5.1.1.2	
Proof of currency is the judge’s USPA membership card and logbook. 
5.1.2	
National Judges
5.1.2.1	
A National Judge rating, unless renewed as outlined below, automatically expires at the end of the fifth calendar year be­
ginning in the award/renewal year. The first such expirations can occur no earlier than December 31, 2025.

For example, if a Formation Skydiving National Judge rating was awarded on March 6, 2021, that rating could expire as early 
as December 31, 2025.

If at the time of expiration, the rating holder meets the renewal requirements for a Performance National Judge, their 
rating will instead be converted to Performance National Judge. If the holder had been on the ISC Judges List at the time of 
the expiration, they remain eligible to be on the list as an International Category-2 Judge.

A Performance National Judge Rating will expire at the end of the 2nd calendar year after the holder last reported perfor­
mance record judging activity in their annual report due December 1.
5.1.2.2	 A National Judge rating may be renewed prior to expiration as follows:
•	
Upon successful completion of a USPA-approved National rating or FAI initial or renewal course.
•	
Upon successful performance serving as a Principal Judge, Event Judge, or Chief Judge, at either a USPA National Cham­
pionships, National Collegiate Championships, or an FAI First- or Second Category Event in the relevant discipline.
•	
Upon successful performance as a Judge Examiner at an approved USPA course, or Chief of Judge Training at an FAI First 
Category Event.
•	
Upon successful completion of an Evaluation by a Judge Examiner, which includes the National written test in the discipline, 
and the corresponding practical evaluation that would otherwise be administered in a National Judge Training Course. If 
successful, the Judge Examiner must submit an After-Action-Report to USPA’s Competition Department prior to the last 
business day before expiration of the rating would otherwise occur.
5.1.2.3	 If a judge is selected to judge at a USPA National Collegiate Skydiving Championships and that judge’s National rating expires 
in the same competition year as, that rating is automatically extended to include only the official competition days. Section 
5.1.2.2 applies from the original competition year, not the extended days.
5.1.2.4	 A Performance National Judge Rating may be promoted to a National Judge rating upon successful completion of an Evalu­
ation or full National Judge Training Course. An expired Performance National Judge Rating is no longer renewable. A new 
application is required.
5.1.2.5	 At the time when any National Judge rating is to be expired (or converted to a Performance National Judge rating), if no cor­
responding Regional Judge Rating exists for that member, it will be created automatically.

3.  U.S. State And National Record Reporting Procedures
3.1.  Introduction
3.1.1	
The purpose of this document is to assist USPA members interested in establishing U.S. state and national skydiving records.
3.1.2	
State and national records documentation and processing differs from those established by the International Skydiving Com­
mission for international records. Those differences are described herein.
3-1
SKYDIVER’S COMPETITION MANUAL  |  OCTOBER 2025
Chapter 3: State, National And International Record Reporting Procedures
3.2.  General
3.2.1	
All USPA competition rules in the Skydiver’s Competition Manual must be observed during national competition record attempts, 
including the citizenship/residency requirements.
3.2.2	 For state competition records, all pertinent rules in the SCM must be observed; however, a variance with those SCM require­
ments that do not affect the performance outcome may be allowed if approved in advance by the USPA Director of Competition 
and the USPA Competition Committee.
3.2.3	 All competition records in events with multiple classes may only be set in the Open class of competition.
3.2.4	 When a state or national record category requires a dive sequence to be drawn from the dive pool, the draw may be conducted 
by any person under the supervision of a USPA Judge rated in the discipline involved, who does not have to be in the physical 
location where the draw is being conducted. 
3.2.5	 For all types of large formation and seqeuential large formation record (FS, VFS, CF, WS), a written plan of the record perfor­
mance(s) describing the formations, and the transitions to be attempted and the persons involved, list of participants, including 
names and USPA membership numbers, and all record types and subtypes being attempted must be submitted to at least one 
certifying Judge prior to the attempt. The formations and transitions must be completed as planned (“grip perfect,” but need not 
be slot-name specific). Video is required as evidence of performance. The record claim documentation must include a copy of 
all original media used to judge the record and the written plan.
•	
For FS/VFS large formation records, there is no minimum hold time, but the formations must be performed in a controlled manner.
3.2.6	 State and national records may be set within or outside of USPA National Championship events.
3.2.7	
An “attempt” is defined as the association of a jump with a full record specification (zone, subclass, discipline, category, type/
subtype). There can be multiple attempts per jump, but each record specification must be distinct, and where a written plan is 
required by the type, each attempt’s plan must be itemized accordingly.
3.2.8	 When a change is made to the criteria applicable to a record such that the ratified record does not comply with the new criteria, 
or a record’s type, sub-type, or category are deleted, the ratified record will be marked RETIRED and will no longer be considered 
a current record.
3.2.9	 For all large formation sequential record types (including Full Break) (FS, CF, WS), a successfully awarded record performance 
supersedes prior smaller records set in the respective subtype (#formations) and for all lesser subtypes as well including Largest 
Formation (1-point). Ie. A 100-way 3-point performance supersedes a 99-way 2-point, and a 90-way (1-point) within the given record 
type, zone & category. Only the greatest subtype record need be claimed to supersede the lesser subtypes.
3.2.10	 Simultaneous records are possible if more than one claimant achieves exactly the same performance in the same conditions as 
another. 
•	
The same conditions are met for Performance Records if all claimants exit on the same pass of the same aircraft for all skydives 
involved in the performance. 
•	
The same conditions are met for Competition Records if all claimants achieve the performance in the same round or rounds of 
the same competition. The record will be registered in the joint names of the concerned persons whether individuals or team 
members. In all cases, not only the date of the performance should appear in the record claim but also the local time at which the 
performance occurred and, where applicable, the round of the competition in which it took place.
3.3.  Record Zones
3.3.1	
State: any record achieved by an individual or team in a state or territory of the United States.
3.3.1.1	
Skydivers claiming individual state records must be regular USPA members. For teams claiming a large formation record, at 
least 51% of the participants must be USPA members; the remaining participants must either be USPA members or hold the 
international equivalent
3.3.1.2	 Where the relevant State for a State record may be in question, the State must be pre-declared, and the majority of partici­
pants must land in the declared State.
3.3.2	 USPA National: any record achieved by an individual or team. 
3.3.2.1	 All record participants must be US citizens or legal US residents and hold a current regular USPA membership.
3.3.2.2	 For National Competition Records in Events in which USA teams compete internationally, all record participants must be eligible 
by FAI rules to represent the USA at an FAI/ISC First Category Event at the time of the record performance. Holding a current 
USA-issued FAI Sporting License is not a requirement when the performance happens outside international competition.
3.3.3	 USPA Open National: Any record achieved by a team in the United States. 
3.3.3.1	 More than 50% of participants must hold a current regular USPA membership. The remaining participants must hold an 
international equivalent or a valid foreign-issued FAI sporting license suitable for Parachuting.

3.8.1.1	
Exit altitude
•	
When the supporting evidence comes from an altitude recording device carried by the skydiver, at least one of the Cer­
tifying Officials must be judge rated in either Speed Skydiving or Wingsuit Flying who will evaluate the data. Exit Altitude 
records may be certified by the pilot when the claimed altitude comes from the aircraft altimeter.
•	
Container opening altitude must be no lower than 2500’ AGL.
3.8.1.2	 Distance of Fall Record
The record performance for the distance of fall is either:
(a) The vertical distance of fall, measured in meters, without a drogue, from exit altitude to the altitude at which the fall is 
terminated as measured by the required equipment, as per paragraph 3.8.1.4 below. 
(b) The vertical distance of fall, measured in meters, with a drogue, from exit altitude to the altitude at which the fall is ter­
minated as measured by the required equipment, as per paragraph 3.8.1.4 below. 
3.8.1.3	 A new altitude, distance of fall record is set only if the lower limit of the error range of the record performance is greater 
than the upper limit of the current record error range by at least 2%. No means of propulsion may be used after leaving or 
jettisoning the device by which the individual has been carried to the exit altitude.

Chapter 3: State, National And International Record Reporting Procedures
3.8.1.4	 The exit altitude and the vertical distance of fall with or without a drogue records are to be determined using an appropri­
ate flight recorder, calibrated barograph or other reliable and appropriate method. The record file submitted must contain:
(a) Calibration data to substantiate the accuracy of the data submitted, including the margin of error. 
(b) Evidence that the data cannot be and has not been tampered with between the time it is recorded and the time it is handed 
over to a Speed Skydiving or Wingsuit Flying Judge. 
(c) Evidence that the instrument registers and provides the type and accuracy of data required to determine the record 
performance. 
3.8.1.5	 The performance shall, if possible, be determined with an overall margin of error of +/- 1%. If the overall margin of error in 
the determination of the performance is no more than +/- 1%, the value of the record shall be equal to the figure determined 
rounded down to the nearest whole number together with the margin of error. If the overall margin of error in the determi­
nation of the performance is greater than +/- 1%, the value of the record shall be equal to the lower limit of the actual error 
range, rounded down to a whole number.
3.8.1.6	 Exit altitude means the altitude above mean sea level at which the individual leaves or jettisons the device (aircraft, aerodyne, 
or aerostat) in or by which he is being carried.
3.8.1.7	 National and International records must be determined using an appropriate flight recorder or other reliable and appropriate 
method (reference FAI GS 8). State exit altitude records may use an FAA-approved and calibrated encoding altimeter, or may 
use the equipment required for National and International records.
3.8.1.8	 All record applications submitted for altitude/fall/WS flight shall include the make and model of aircraft, and maximum op­
erating altitude of that aircraft as specified in its FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet or FAA Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH). 
The maximum operating altitude is based on barometric altitude, that is, altitude indicated when the aircraft altimeter is set 
to 29.92”, unless otherwise specified in the documents aforementioned. No record application will be accepted that exceeds 
such limitations.
3.8.1.9	 Time of fall/wingsuit distance of flight records are to be determined using an appropriate flight recorder or other reliable 
and appropriate method (reference FAI GS 8).
3.8.2	 Speed Skydiving Individual Performance Records
3.8.2.1	 A new vertical speed jump record is set only if the lower limit of the error range of the record performance is greater than 
the upper limit of the current record error range by at least 2%. Exit means the point in time at which the individual leaves 
or jettisons the device in or by which he is being carried. 
3.8.2.2	 No means of propulsion may be used after leaving or jettisoning the device by which the individual has been carried to the 
exit point.
3.8.2.3	 The vertical speed in freefall or in drogue fall is to be determined using an appropriate flight recorder, calibrated barograph, 
or other reliable and appropriate method (reference FAI GS). The record file submitted must contain: 
(a) Calibration data to substantiate the accuracy of the data submitted, including the margin of error.
(b) Evidence that the data cannot be and has not been tampered with between the time it is recorded and the time it is handed 
over to a judge.
(c) Evidence that the instrument registers and provides the type and accuracy of data required to determine the record 
performance.
3.8.2.4	 The record performance is one of the following: 
•	
The maximum vertical speed attained, measured in km/h, without a drogue during the time from exit to the altitude at 
which the fall is terminated as measured by the required equipment, as per paragraph 3.8.2.3 above. (Maximum Vertical 
Speed without drogue)
•	
The maximum vertical speed attained, measured in km/h, with a drogue during the time from exit to the altitude at which 
the fall is terminated as measured by the required equipment, as per paragraph 3.8.2.3 above. (Maximum Vertical Speed 
with drogue)

3.9.  Procedures
3.9.1	
Records are registered by submitting the “Request for Certification of State and National Record” form contained herein 
(uspa.org/scm).
3.9.2	 State records must be certified and signed by two authorized officials, as follows:
•	
Authorized officials include USPA-rated judges, the local S&TA or S&TA “at large” for the local region, USPA Examiners, a USPA 
board member or headquarters staff member, and in some cases, the pilot.
•	
Discipline-specific records (for example, canopy formation, formation skydiving, wingsuit flying) must be certified by at least one 
judge rated in the applicable discipline. For disciplines judged by video or data analysis, the judge does not need to be physically 
present during the record attempt. At least one certifying official must still be present.
•	
When a record requires certification by a discipline-specific judge, the second official may be any of those authorized above, 
including a second judge (who need not be rated in the applicable discipline).
•	
Exit altitude and most jumps in 24-hour records may be certified by a FAA-rated pilot directly involved with the record attempt. 
These are the only two records a pilot may certify.
•	
Officials certifying a team performance state record may also be participants. 
3.9.3	 National competition records must be conducted and judged in accordance with the SCM rules for national competition. National 
performance records must be certified by at least two national judges and one regional judge, all of whom must be rated in the 
applicable discipline.
3.9.4	 VFS orientation record performances may be evaluated and certified by either AE or FS Judges or a combination thereof, all having 
a valid rating in the appropriate discipline. The on-site judge required by §3.9.6 may have either rating as well.
3.9.5	 State and National competition records set at a USPA National Skydiving Championships, or State and National competition 
records set at an FAI First Category Event by members of the US Parachute Team, as determined by the certified competition 
results, shall be registered in the USPA records database without fee or filing requirements by request from either the Com­
petitor/Team or the Chief Judge, sent to competition@uspa.org. Only the best performance of a single event will be given this 
treatment. A competitor or team may claim additional records at their own expense.
3.9.6	 Judges must be physically present to observe national records, except for disciplines (CF, FS, WS, SP) judged exclusively by video 
and/or data analysis, in which case at least one discipline-rated judge must be present to witness the attempt and collect video 
and/or other required evidence. 
3.9.7	
Judges may not take part in national records that they certify though they may be videographers on performance records.
3.10.  Notification and Fees
3.10.1	 Initial notification of a national record must be sent to USPA by e-mail (competition@uspa.org) within 72 hours of the jump. There 
is no initial notification requirement for a state record.
3.10.2	 The final claim form with required documentation for all records must be received by USPA’s Competition Department within 30 
days of the record performance. An extension of the 30-day deadline may be granted by the USPA Director of Competition, at their 
discretion, but only prior to the original deadline. Record fees for National & State record claims (not including extra-certificate 
fees) must be received within 30 days of notice that the record has met all the requirements for ratification.

ings in the open class at the most recently completed U.S. National Championships.

The competition from which the results will be used to select the team must be held at least 60 days prior to the competition 
at which the team will compete.

For the purposes of this rule, an Alternate is defined as the team member, or those team members, in excess of the minimum 
team size, who participated in the fewest competition skydives (including re-jumps and tie-breaks) in the selection event.

bers who made the fewest skydives.

Teams unable to satisfy these requirements after having registered for the international competition are required to withdraw.

All roster changes or role changes between alternates and non-alternates at the FCE must be reported to the US Team Man­
ager immediately, or to the USPA Director of Competition within 7 days of the role switch if no Team Manager is present.

Landing control: The competitor will receive a 15-meter penalty if:
•	
the first point of contact is not within the 30.4-meter-diameter circle, or;
•	
the competitor fails to contain the landing within the 30.4-meter-diameter circle.
4.8.  Judging and Recording Sport Accuracy
4.8.1	
Landings are judged by at least three principal judges; in addition, there will be one observer person and one wind person.
4.8.2	 The only persons allowed within the 30.4-meter circle during jumping are members of the panel of judges and necessary mem­
bers of the organizing staff.
4.8.3	 The dead-center target must be repositioned immediately after the landing of any competitor who moves or covers its location, 
except during team jumps when there is insufficient time between the landings of team members.
4.8.4	 After a landing, competitors must leave the target area immediately.
4.8.5	 An official appointed by the Meet Director and approved by the Chief Judge will observe the wind speed and direction at the 
anemometer.
4.8.6	 One or more observers should watch each jump made and observe the competitors on opening and during their descent.
4.8.6.1	 The observer should check the time between opening and landing and any conditions that might constitute grounds for a 
rejump.
4.8.6.2	 A written record should be made of the observations.
4.8.7	
If any judge observes a change in winds aloft which prevent one or more competitors from making a reasonable accuracy ap­
proach on the target despite having exited at the correct point, that judge must immediately inform the Event Judge or the Chief 
Judge of the observation.
4.8.8	 If there is a serious or sudden change in the meteorological conditions or in the winds aloft, the Chief Judge or the Event Judge, 
with the concurrence of the Meet Director, may decide to interrupt an event.
4.8.8.1	 This decision is not grounds for a protest.
4.8.8.2	 The interruption must be made in a way which clearly shows it to the jumpers concerned, who must be granted rejumps, and 
also to the judges at the target.
4.9.  Judging and Recording Team Sport Accuracy
4.9.1	
Landings are judged as in Sport Accuracy
4.9.2	 The sum of the four individual scores is the team score for the round.
4.9.2.1	 Teams landing with fewer than four members will receive the max score for each missing member.
4.10.  Technical Equipment
4.10.1	 Wind Indicators
•	
A large wind indicator must be capable of responding to winds of at least two (2) m/s and shall be positioned between 30 and 50 
meters from the target center. It must be clearly visible from 3000’ as determined by the Meet Director and Chief Judge.
•	
A wind-direction indicator (streamer) capable of responding to winds of less than two (2) m/s shall be positioned within 20 meters 
outside the 30.4-meter circle.
•	
The Chief Judge will decide the positions of the wind indicating devices, ensuring that both are fully visible for competitors ap­
proaching the course and that they do not create a hazard. The positions may be changed during the competition as necessary. 
This decision is not subject to protest
4.11.  Equipment and Clothing
4.11.1	 Competitors will be assigned numbers before the competition, and the assigned number must be visible on the individual during

7-3
SKYDIVER’S COMPETITION MANUAL  |  OCTOBER 2025
Chapter 7: USPA National Collegiate Skydiving Championships Competition Rules
4.11.1.1	 A competitor who willfully fails to properly display the assigned number shall receive the maximum score for that jump.
4.12.  Rejumps
4.12.1	 In Sport Accuracy, a rejump may be awarded if a competitor:
4.12.1.1	 Experiences a malfunction:
•	
A competitor experiencing a control problem or malfunction requiring the use of the reserve canopy must not navigate 
the course and must utilize an alternate landing area if safe to do so.
•	
If a judge’s inspection reveals that the canopy’s condition resulted from faulty equipment, unacceptable rigging or de­
ployment technique, or from any situation illustrating improper judgment or lack of control by a competitor, no rejump 
will be awarded.
4.12.1.2	 In the opinion of any judge is prevented by winds aloft from making a reasonable accuracy approach on the target, though 
having exited at the correct point
4.12.1.3	 Is in the air during an official period of halted jumping due to exceeded wind speed or any other reason deemed appropriate 
by the Chief Judge or Meet Director.
4.12.1.4	 Rejump resulting from a conflict
•	
A rejump may be awarded to any competitor for whom the Event Judge determines that a canopy conflict with another 
jumper hampered his or her approach.
•	
If the conflict is with the competitor’s own teammate, the team is not awarded a rejump, and the competitor’s score for 
the landing after the canopy conflict counts toward the team score for that round.
4.13.  Safety
4.13.1	 The Chief Judge, Meet Director or USPA Controller may issue a yellow card for a safety violation. They will be issued in general 
for unsafe actions, lack of sufficient canopy control or erratic canopy handling.
4.13.2	 A second yellow card is the equivalent of the issuance of a red card.
4.13.3	 The Chief Judge, Meet Director or USPA Controller may issue a red card without a prior yellow card for any action that presents 
immediate danger and safety hazard to the competitor or others on the ground. Examples of this include low approaches over 
the crowd or flying the canopy in an uncontrolled manner into any person or objects in or outside of the course.
4.13.4	 The issuance of a red card will result in the disqualification of the competitor from further participation in the Sport Accuracy 
event, including the deletion of any results achieved already during the competition. They will be marked as “disqualified” in the 
ranking list after all competitors with regular results.

will be considered as only one omission.
5.5.3	 If an infringement in the scoring formation of a block sequence is carried into the inter, this will be considered as one infringement 
only, provided that the intent of the inter requirements for the next formation is clearly presented and no other infringement 
occurs in the inter.
5.5.4	 The minimum score for any round is zero points.
5.5.5	 It is the responsibility of the team to clearly present the correct scoring formations, inters, and total separations to the videog­
rapher and the judges.
5.5.6	 Scoring formations need not be perfectly symmetrical, but they must be performed in a controlled manner.
5.5.7	
Mirror images of random formations and whole block sequences are permitted.
5.6.  Definitions
5.6.1	
A scoring formation is a formation that is correctly completed and clearly presented either as a random formation or within a 
block sequence as depicted in the dive pool, and which, apart from the first formation after exit, must be preceded by a correctly 
completed and clearly presented total separation or inter, as appropriate. 
5.6.2	 A grip consists of stationary contact between any part of the palm side of the hand and/or fingers, and on an arm leg or foot of 
another jumper as shown in Appendix A.
5.6.3	 A foot grip consists of a handhold on the foot; the grip must be on or below the anklebone, as shown in the Definition of Symbols 
in this section.
5.6.4	 An inter is an intermediate requirement which must be performed as depicted in the block portions of the dive pools.
5.6.5	 A subgroup consists of an individual or two or more jumpers linked by a grip or grips. 
5.6.5.1	 When shown, each subgroup must remain intact as a subgroup from the break of the previous scoring formation in the se­
quence until the correct completion of the next scoring formation in the sequence.
5.6.5.2	 Where degrees are shown, (180º, 270º, 360º, 540º), this indicates the approximate degrees and direction of turn required to 
complete the inter as indicated. The degrees shown are approximately that amount of the circumference of the subgroup’s 
center point to be presented to the center point(s) of the other subgroup(s). For judging purposes, the approximate degrees 
and direction of turn of subgroups’ center points will be assessed using only the two-dimensional video evidence as presented. 
Degrees of turn performed must be in a single direction.
5.6.6	 Contact is allowed between subgroups during the inter of a block sequence. 
•	
Any assisting body contact on other jumpers or their equipment within a subgroup or a scoring formation is not permitted. 
•	
Where subgroups are shown, they must remain intact as a subgroup with only the depicted grips on other jumpers in that subgroup. 
•	
Handholds by the jumper on their own body within a subgroup or a scoring formation are permitted.
•	
If an inter requires an orientation change by a subgroup, no grip may be taken between that subgroup and any other subgroup 
during the orientation change.
5.6.7	
A subgroup’s centerpoint is one of the following:
•	
The defined grip or the geometric center of the defined grips within a subgroup within linked jumpers
•	
The geometric center of an individual’s torso
5.6.8	 An infringement is one of the following:
7-5
SKYDIVER’S COMPETITION MANUAL  |  OCTOBER 2025
Chapter 7: USPA National Collegiate Skydiving Championships Competition Rules
5.6.8.1	 An incorrect or incomplete formation which is followed within working time by either—
•	
A total separation or
•	
An inter, whether correct or not
5.6.8.2	 A correctly completed formation preceded by an incorrect inter or incorrect total separation
5.6.8.3	 A formation, inter, or total separation not clearly presented
5.6.9	 Omission is one of the following:
5.6.9.1	 A formation or inter is missing from the drawn sequence.
5.6.9.2	 No clear intent to build the correct formation or inter is seen, but another formation or inter is presented, and there is an 
advantage to the team resulting from the substitution.
5.6.10	 Separation
5.6.10.1	 Total separation is when all competitors show at one point in time, they have released all their grips and no part of their arms 
are in contact with another body.
5.6.10.2	Total separation is required between whole blocks, between random formations, and between whole blocks and random 
formations.
5.7.  Judging and Recording
5.7.1	
Judges are stationed at video monitors to observe each team’s performance. 
5.7.2	
The judges will watch the video evidence of each jump once at normal speed to determine points in time. A second timing will 
be allowed if the last point in time is in question. At the end of working time, freeze frame will be applied on each full viewing. 
At the discretion of the Chief Judge, judges may be allowed partial playback, slow motion, and multiple views to increase the 
quality and speed of judging. If, during the judging cycle, the Chief Judge, Event Judge, or any judge on the panel considers that 
an absolutely incorrect assessment has occurred, that assessment will be brought to the attention of the Event Judge to ensure 
that it has been correctly scored by the majority of the panel judges.
5.7.3	
The judges will use an electronic scoring system (if one is available) to record their evaluation of the performance. The judges may 
correct their evaluation record after the jump has been judged. Corrections to the evaluation record may only be made before 
the chief judge signs the score sheet. All individual judge’s evaluations will be published.
5.7.4	
The results of the evaluation will be checked by at least one judge, under the supervision of the Chief Judge.
5.7.5	
Scoresheets
5.7.5.1	
If electronic scoring is not available, the judges will operate their own stopwatches and use a scoresheet to record their 
evaluation, using the following symbols:
5.7.6	
In this case, the scoresheets of all judges must be collected immediately after the judges have scored the jump for evaluation by 
the scoring section.

SKYDIVER’S COMPETITION MANUAL  |  OCTOBER 2025
Chapter 8: USPA National Accuracy Landing Championships Competition Rules
1.  General
1.1.  Objectives
1.1.1	
Accuracy Landing consists of competitors under parachute aiming to land on or as closely as possible to the center of a target.
1.1.2	
It is up to each competitor to clearly present to the judges the first contact with the target.
1.2.  Event
1.2.1	
The discipline will include the following events:
1.2.1.1	
Individual Accuracy Landing
1.2.1.2	
Team Accuracy Landing
1.3.  Accuracy Landing Event Description
1.3.1	
Individual Accuracy Landing: 
1.3.1.1	
Each round consists of individual competitors guiding their canopies to a precision landing on an Automatic Measuring Device 
(AMD) with a two-centimeter-diameter (2 cm) dead-center target. 
1.3.1.2	
Individual competitors are not required to compete in Team Accuracy.
1.3.2	
Team Accuracy: Each round consists of a team of four competitors making sequential precision approaches as described in 
Individual Accuracy Landing.
1.3.2.1	
Normally, the Accuracy Landing competition is conducted in a team format for the first eight rounds. 
1.3.2.2	 No substitutes to the composition of a team are permitted for any reason after competition begins.
1.4.  Wind Drift Indicators (WDI)
1.4.1	
Before starting the Accuracy Event or if jumping has been interrupted for 60 minutes or more, a WDI is dropped from 2,500 feet 
over the drop zone by a judge or non-competing, experienced skydiver. 
1.4.2	
The WDI landing point is marked by a signal panel or on an aerial photo of the area or indicated in the best available method to 
all competitors. 
1.4.3	
Additional WDIs are dropped if the Chief Judge, consulting with other principal judges, decides that altered wind conditions 
render the proper opening point uncertain.
1.4.4	
Observation of a WDI or canopies successfully landing in the target area or uninterrupted continuity of the Accuracy Event are 
sufficient data to evaluate the proper opening point, and no protests will be allowed for lack of this knowledge.
1.5.  Exit Order, Altitude and Procedures
1.5.1	
The order of jumping in each round will be individuals, followed by teams. Teams will jump in reverse order of standing at the 
discretion of the Chief Judge in coordination with the Meet Director.
1.5.2	
Rounds nine and ten will be individual, in reverse order of standing at the discretion of the Chief Judge in coordination with the 
Meet Director.
1.5.3	
Individual Accuracy Landing: Each jump is made from 3,000 feet and jumpers will exit one or two per pass, which the Meet Di­
rector may lower by as much as 300 feet to negotiate weather.
1.5.4	
Team Accuracy:
1.5.4.1	
Each jump is made from 3,500 feet, which the Meet Director may lower to 2,800 feet for the whole round to negotiate weather. 
1.5.4.2	 The team must jump from the same aircraft during the same passage of the aircraft over the target. 
1.5.5	
Each competitor or team is personally responsible for selecting a proper exit point.
1.6.  Number of Rounds
1.6.1	
Individual Accuracy Landing: The minimum number of rounds to constitute a meet is one , and the maximum (scheduled) number 
is ten.
1.6.2	
Team Accuracy Landing: The minimum number of rounds to constitute a meet is one, and the maximum (scheduled) number of 
rounds is eight.
1.7.  Weather
1.7.1	
Observation of wind speed and direction will be made at the discretion of the Event Judge until such time as winds exceed three 
(3) meters per second (m/s).
8-1
SKYDIVER’S COMPETITION MANUAL  |  OCTOBER 2025
Chapter 8: USPA National Accuracy Landing Championships Competition Rules
1.7.2	
When the wind speed on the ground is greater than three (3) m/s, the wind speed will be monitored constantly and documented 
at an interval of no greater than every two (2) minutes.
1.7.3	
The maximum allowable wind speed at ground level in the Accuracy Events is set by the Chief Judge, Event Judge, and Meet 
Director within the range of between six (6) m/s and seven and a half (7.5) m/s. 
1.7.3.1	
This limit will be given to the competitors at the initial briefing and will remain for the duration of the competition. 
1.7.3.2	
Scoring must stop while the wind exceeds this limit for a period of 30 seconds.
1.7.3.3	
A competitor who lands during the period 15 seconds before the wind speed exceeds the limit, while the wind speed is over 
the limit, and 30 seconds after the wind speed has returned below the limit, and does not score a dead center, will be offered 
a rejump. The competitor must make an immediate decision and inform the Event or Chief Judge of their decision, otherwise 
that competitor must do a rejump.
1.7.3.4	
The event will be automatically interrupted, and the target covered for a minimum of five minutes if the ground wind speed 
exceeds nine (9) m/s.
•	
Any competitor who exits the aircraft during a period of halted jumping will be waved off and not allowed to land on the 
tuffet. 
•	
All competitors who are waved off will make a rejump.
1.7.4	
An audible device capable of being heard by the judges scoring in the pit must be used to alert the judges of a wind hold. 
1.7.4.1	
This device may be a whistle or horn manually sounded by the person monitoring the wind speed.
1.7.4.2	
It may also be an audible device integrated into the monitoring device itself.
1.7.5	
The maximum allowable wind direction limit is exceeded when there is a change in ground wind direction of 90 degrees or more 
when the wind speed exceeds three (3) m/s during final approach.
1.7.5.1	
If there is a sudden change in ground wind direction of more than 90 degrees when the wind speed is more than three (3) 
m/s and automatically recorded by an electronic device, a competitor landing within 30 seconds after the wind change will 
be offered a rejump. The competitor must make an immediate decision.
1.8.  Scoring
1.8.1	
Individual Accuracy Landing: 
1.8.1.1	
The landing point is the first point of body contact with the surface or the AMD. 
1.8.1.2	
A landing off the AMD (or at the edge) or a disqualified jump is scored as 16 cm. 
1.8.2	
Team Accuracy: 
1.8.2.1	
Landings are judged as described for Individual Accuracy Landing. 
1.8.2.2	 All four scores count. 
1.8.2.3	 If, because of insufficient separation between team members, a competitor lands on the AMD before it has been reset, the 
score given is 15 cm.
1.8.2.4	 Competitors landing off the AMD for any reason, including insufficient separation with their team members, will be given a 
score of 16 cm. 
1.8.2.5	 The sum of individual scores is the score of the team for that round. 
1.8.2.6	 Teams landing with fewer than four members receive a score of 16 cm for each missing member. 
1.9.  Judging and Recording
1.9.1	
Landings will be judged by at least three principal judges positioned around the target, who independently assess the landing. 
The decision of the judges will be made by simple majority.
1.9.2	
A Video Viewing system must be available and may be used for all competition jumps (for example: tablet with slow motion) at 
the discretion of the event-/chief judge for any decision found necessary. This decision is not grounds for protest.
1.9.3	
In addition to the panel of judges at the target, there will be one canopy-flight observer and one wind recorder—not necessarily 
judges—qualified for the tasks and approved by the Chief/Event Judge.
1.9.4	
The only persons allowed within the 20-meter circle during jumping are members of the panel of judges, members of the Jury 
and necessary members of the organizing staff. 
1.9.4.1	
During the final approach of a competitor, only principal judges are allowed within five meters. 
1.9.4.2	 Exceptions to this rule are the responsibility of the Chief Judge.
8-2
SKYDIVER’S COMPETITION MANUAL  |  OCTOBER 2025
Chapter 8: USPA National Accuracy Landing Championships Competition Rules
1.9.5	
The AMD must be repositioned immediately after the landing of any competitor who moves or covers its location, except during 
team jumps when there is insufficient time between the landings of team members.
1.9.6	
After a landing, competitors must leave the target area immediately.
1.9.7	
One or more observers should watch each competitor’s/team’s opening and monitor their descent. 
1.9.7.1	
The observer should check the time between opening and landing and any conditions which might constitute grounds for 
a rejump.
1.9.7.2	
A written record should be made of the observations.
1.9.8	
If any judge observes a change in winds aloft which prevent one or more competitors from making a reasonable accuracy ap­
proach on the target despite having exited at the correct point, that judge must immediately inform the Event Judge or the Chief 
Judge of the observation. 
1.9.9	
If there is a serious or sudden change in the meteorological conditions or in the winds aloft, the Chief Judge or the Event Judge, 
with the concurrence of the Meet Director, may decide to interrupt an event. 
1.9.9.1	
This decision is not grounds for a protest.
1.9.9.2	 The interruption must be made in a way which clearly shows it to the jumpers concerned, who must be granted rejumps, and 
also to the judges at the target.
1.9.9.3	 A new WDI must be dropped before the event may continue.
1.10.  Technical Equipment
1.10.1	 Large Wind Indicator:
1.10.1.1	 The large wind indicator must be capable of responding to winds of at least two (2) m/s and must be clearly visible from 3000’ 
as determined by the Meet Director & Chief Judge. 
•	
The judges determine its location, which is at a fixed place approximately 50 meters from the target center. 
•	
Placement of the large wind indicator is not subject to any protest.
1.10.1.2	 A wind direction indicator (streamer) mounted on a pole, which is capable of responding to winds of less than two (2) m/s, 
is placed by the Event Judge within 20 meters of the target.
1.10.2	 Wind-speed measuring device: 
1.10.2.1	 Meet management is responsible for providing a single, accurate wind-speed measuring device capable of displaying wind 
velocity in meters per second. 
1.10.2.2	 The device should be at least six (6) meters above ground level.
1.10.3	 Target: The AMD must be centered within a marked circle of 20 meters radius
1.10.3.1	 The center of the target must be an AMD.
•	
The AMD will have a dead-center disc of two (2) cm in diameter in a contrasting color.
•	
The AMD must be capable of measuring to a minimum distance of 16 cm.
1.10.3.2	 The AMD is placed centrally on a foam or air tuffet with the following specifications:
•	
Diameter: approximately five (5) meters
•	
Thickness: a minimum of 30 cm
•	
Color: any color
1.11.  Equipment and Clothing
1.11.1	
Competitor numbers 
1.11.1.1	
Competitors will be assigned numbers before the competition, and the assigned number must be visible on the individual 
during the events. 
1.11.1.2	 A competitor who willfully fails to properly display the assigned number is disqualified for that jump.
1.11.2	 Footwear
8-3
SKYDIVER’S COMPETITION MANUAL  |  OCTOBER 2025
Chapter 8: USPA National Accuracy Landing Championships Competition Rules
1.11.2.1	 Footwear must not damage the AMD. The sole must be flat without any knob protruding from it. On the horizontal plane, the 
portion of the shoe touching the target must have a minimum diameter of one (1) cm. On the vertical plane, the angle of the 
part of the sole touching the target must have an angle of 90°(plus or minus 15°) as depicted in the diagram. The EJ has the 
right to disqualify the use of specific footwear at any time. This decision is not grounds for protest.
1.11.2.2	 Meet management has the right to refuse the use of specific footwear.
1.12.  Aircraft
1.12.1	 A variety or combination of aircraft may be used.
1.12.2	 Aircraft speed at time of exit must not exceed 87 knots (100 mph) indicated.
1.12.3	 Any slower speed desired will be through mutual agreement of pilot and competitor. 
1.13.  Rejumps
1.13.1	 In Accuracy Landing, a rejump may be awarded if a competitor:
1.13.1.1	 is given an erroneous score by the AMD (determined by a simple majority of the principal judges)
1.13.1.2	 experiences a malfunction:
•	
An accuracy competitor with a main canopy malfunction creating a control problem must indicate on opening that a 
problem exists by signaling with arms and legs apart and making no attempt to land in the target area.
•	
A judge must verify by equipment inspection or observation that the competitor had a malfunction.
•	
A control problem is a condition in the canopy deployment making it virtually impossible to safely attempt a precision 
target approach or a canopy configuration that prevents a competitor from demonstrating his or her skill. 
•	
If a judge’s inspection reveals that the canopy’s condition resulted from faulty equipment, unacceptable rigging or de­
ployment technique, or from any situation illustrating improper judgment or lack of control by a competitor, no rejump 
will be awarded.
1.13.1.3	 in the opinion of any judge is prevented by winds aloft from making a reasonable accuracy approach on the target, though 
having exited at the correct point
1.13.1.4	 is subjected to conditions exceeding the wind direction limits (verified by the Chief Judge or a designated judge)
1.13.1.5	 is in the air during an official period of halted jumping due to exceeded wind speed 
1.13.2	 Rejump resulting from a conflict:
1.13.2.1	 A rejump may be awarded to any competitor for whom the Event Judge determines that a canopy conflict with another jumper 
hampered his or her approach. 
1.13.2.2	 If the conflict is with the competitor’s own teammate:
•	
The rejump is awarded to the individual for his or her individual score.
•	
The team is not awarded a rejump, and the competitor’s score for the landing after the canopy conflict counts toward 
the team score for that round.
1.13.3	 If an AMD is found to be defective or unintentionally not reset and the first point of contact has been on it, the affected com­
petitor(s) must be offered a rejump.
2.  Classification Of Final Results

Appendix A: Accuracy Landing 
Administration And Judging Notes
Note: The guidelines in this section are included to assist judges in the performance of their duties but are not grounds for protest.
1.1.  Accuracy Landing Event
1.1.1	
Prior to the start of the Accuracy Landing event, the Chief Judge, Event Judge, and Meet Director may agree to postpone or 
suspend the event when certain conditions exist that make it impossible for the competitors to fairly demonstrate their skill. 
These conditions may be due, but not limited to, existing obstacles that adversely affect wind conditions for Accuracy Landing.
1.2.  Scoring 
1.2.1	
The center of the target must be an automatic measuring device with a dead center of two centimeters (2 cm) diameter in a 
contrasting color, hereafter referred to as the AMD.
1.2.2	
The AMD must be kept as flat as possible and capable of measuring out to a distance of 16 cm.
1.2.3	
The AMD should be mounted centrally on an underlying control pad (if one is available) of at least one meter diameter, which 
when struck at any point, scores 16 cm.
1.2.4	
If a control pad is unavailable, the competition may be conducted without it. In this case, a landing off the AMD is determined 
by a simple majority of the principal judges and must be given a score of 16 cm.
1.2.5	
An erroneous reading of the AMD or control pad is determined by a simple majority of the principal judges.
1.2.6	
If the AMD becomes inoperable, it must be replaced with one that is functioning. 
1.2.7	
If the control pad malfunctions and no replacement is available, the current round may be continued without it.
1.2.8	
Winds aloft are those winds occurring above the altitude of the wind-speed measuring device described in this section.
